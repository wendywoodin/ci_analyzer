This is a testing file. Everything should be ignored at the beginning. We test
a variety of different edge cases that the program should be able to handle.
Expected responses are in unit_test_expected_output.txt.

Some cases to be tested:
	I.   Changing an electron from the base configuration when that electron is
	     present
	II.  Going from one entirely filled energy level to two half-filled
	III. Creating a filled level by moving an electron from a half-filled state

For simplicity, each configuration is given a square-root probability value of
0.5 to start, so each configuration will have a final probability of 0.25.

The configurations should do the following:
	- The initial configuration (1) starts out with a hole in 4a, since 4a
	  has an electron and so does 5a. It will contribute 0.25 to the 4a
	  hole category of output.
	- Configuration (2) moves an electron of "/" to 4a from 5a, making 4a become
	  filled. This also has no holes, so it should contribute 0.25 to the 
	  no-hole category of output. This tests (III).
	- Configuration (3) moves an electron from 1b, which is filled, to
	  4a, which should make 1b half-filled and make 4a filled. This will
	  contribute 0.25 to the no hole category of output. This tests (I) and (III).
	- Configuraton (4) moves an electron from 4a to 5a to make 5a filled.
	  It then moves an electron from 3a to 5a. This makes both 3a and 4a holes,
	  and should contribute 0.25 to the hole in 3a and 4a category of output.
	  3a will be counted as two holes because it is below both the filled 5a
	  and the half-filled 4a. This tests both (I) and (III).
	- Configuration (5) filles 4a with an electron from 5a. Then it moves an
	  electron from 1b to 2b, causing 1b to become the sole hole, since it has
	  a single electron and 2b also has an electron. This will contribute 0.25
	  to the 1b hole category of output. This tests (II).

	Overall, therefore, there should be 0.5 in the category of no hole, 0.25 in
	the category of a hole in 4a, 0.25 in the category of a hole in 3a and 54a,
	and 0.25 in the category of a hole in 1b.
